# How to contribute
The community is what makes FastGap Generator great, without you we wouldn't have come so far. But to help us keep our sanity and reach code-nirvana together, please follow these quick rules whenever contributing.


## Opening issues

2. Search for issues similar to yours in [GitHub search](https://github.com/danielfeelfine/generator-fastgap/search?type=Issues).
3. If there's an open issue, please contribute to that issue.
4. If there's a closed issue, open a new issue and link the url of the already closed issue(s).
5. If there is no issue, open a new issue and specify the following:
  - A short description of your issue in the title
  - Detailed explanation of how to recreate the issue
6. If you are experiencing more than one problem, create a separate issue for each one. If you think they might be related, please reference the other issues you've created.



## Submitting Pull Requests

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to our [the develop branch](https://github.com/danielfeelfine/generator-fastgap/tree/develop).
